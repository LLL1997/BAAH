# How to Run

Bilibili: [Latest Tutorial on Homepage](https://space.bilibili.com/7331920?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0)

[BAAH Usage and FAQs.docx](https://docs.qq.com/doc/DR1RPaURleGF0ZWFS)

## Before Running, Please Ensure

1. Set the emulator resolution to 1280*720 pixels, 240 DPI.
2. Enable adb debugging in the emulator settings.
3. In the settings of the Global/Japanese version of BA, pull all options in the graphic settings to the right side, which means low render level (except FPS and rendering acceleration mode).
4. In BA's café, pull the camera to the highest, and it's best to stack all the furniture on the far right of the screen

## How to Use

### Running via exe

1. Unzip the package
2. Double click BAAH_GUI.exe to run

### Running via local python environment

1. Ensure your python version is >=3.10
2. Ensure you have adb.exe on your computer, and modify the ADB_PATH in config.json, or move the adb folder into `./tools/adb`.
3. Execute `git clone https://github.com/sanmusen214/BAAH.git` in the command line
4. Execute `cd BAAH` to enter the project directory
5. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary dependencies
6. Execute `python jsoneditor.py` to run GUI
7. Execute `python main.py config.json` to start running BAAH with user configuration in config.json

# Small Thoughts

Still missing manufacturing

Future discardable code by category: The three functions of the Chinese version's bounty missions to select regions, RaidQuest max times judgement
